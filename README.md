 ##Installation

 ##How to play
 Your pink audacious player needs to get to the river! Use the arrows controls (up, down, left & right) to evade the nasty bugs and win the game. Beware, if the bugs touch the player, it resets your progress to the beginning of the journey.
 ##Resources
 I have used several resources for general inspiration:
 I read this for getting the board to display: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/i-dont-understand-how-to-code-classic-arcade-game/527836/2?u=solittletime
 I consulted Matthew Cranford's tutorials as general resource: https://matthewcranford.com/arcade-game-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code-breakdown/
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz7pHJ65TEk&feature=youtu.be The webinar of Lloan Alas for collision detection
 I also had a 1 on 1 session with Lloan Alas for debugging some details of my game. I quoted what bit he helped me with in the app.js file.
 ##Thank you for taking the time to review my game!
